# NavGNITS

A Mobile Application for Navigation within the Campus of GNITS.

## Getting Started

Navigating a university campus can be a difficult task, especially for new students, faculty, and visitors. Without a reliable navigation system, individuals may face difficulties in locating buildings, classrooms, Labs and faculty cabins, leading to wasted time, frustration, and missed opportunities. NavGNITS is a mobile-based navigation app designed to address these challenges. The app provides users with an interactive map, allowing them to search and locate various departments, classrooms, and facilities within the GNITS campus. Additionally, NavGNITS features indoor positioning and navigation, enabling users to find their way within the buildings. This project aims to improve the overall university experience by providing students, faculty, and visitors with a user-friendly and intuitive navigation solution.
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

**Problem Statement**

Students and visitors often face difficulties in finding specific blocks or rooms within the GNITS campus. Existing solutions like physical signboards or asking staff may not always be efficient or available. There's a need for a digital, interactive, and user-friendly solution to help users identify the location of blocks and rooms and receive clear directions, both outdoors and indoors.

**Scope of the Project**

The project aims to develop a mobile application, NAVGNITS, to help students and visitors navigate the GNITS campus efficiently. It provides two main features: outdoor navigation between campus blocks and indoor identification of specific rooms within buildings. Users can search for any block to view a route from their current location, or search for a room to see the relevant floor map along with a message indicating the block and floor to go to. The application includes preloaded floor maps for all blocks and floors. The scope is limited to providing directional guidance through visual and text-based instructions without real-time tracking or indoor path drawing.

**Objectives Of the Project:**

**Main Objective:**
The main objective of NavGNITS is to create an advanced campus navigation system that allows students, staff, and visitors to efficiently navigate the campus by providing accurate, real-time information. The app aims to guide users to their desired locations within the campus, while also offering feature such as indoor navigation, improving the overall campus experience.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Interactive Mapping: To provide users with an easy-to-use, interactive map that 
allows them to locate various departments, classrooms on campus with no effort.


2.  Provide Accurate Navigation: To offer reliable, location-based directions within the campus, helping users find their way easily to classrooms, offices, and other essential campus locations. This feature will include a pre-loaded map and dynamic route generation based on the userâ€™s current location

3. User-Friendly Interface: To design a simple, intuitive, and user-friendly interface that ensures smooth navigation for all users, regardless of their tech-savviness. The app should be easy to understand and operate for  new visitors, students and staff members.
